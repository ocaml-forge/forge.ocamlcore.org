How to identify you as one of the admin?
* If you were an admin of the project and you Github profile has been created before 2020-09-01, that is enough.
* If you don't have a Github profile that matches the condition above, tell me how to identify you in the bug or send an email to sylvain+ocaml à le-gall.net to identify you.
* If you were not an admin of the project, ask an admin (that can be identified as such, see above) to confirm the transfer by adding a comment to this bug.

What next?
- Send an email to sylvain+ocaml à le-gall.net with your email or GMail address (if the project is big, it will be shared through Google Drive)
- Wait for the confirmation of the admin if you are not one.
- Send a PR to update the project page with the new home.
